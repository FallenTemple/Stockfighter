# Stockfighter

This project provides a C# implementation of the public game APIs for [Stockfighter](https://www.stockfighter.io).

Nothing in here should be considered a spoiler&mdash;this is an implementation of [the public API](https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/getting-started).

My gameplay code (potentially spoilery) will always live in [its own repository](https://github.com/HamsterExAstris/Stockfighter).
